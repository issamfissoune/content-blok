               Back in the dark and gloomy days of the pandemic, students all over the world had trouble studying and focusing on the lesson.
               Schools all over the world would look for different solutions but none were perfect. After some extensive research and alot of brainstorming,
               Worm Hole was born, a free to play, educational game on the pc and laptop.
            </p>
            <p>
               Worm Hole is a game that is supposed to help students study easier while having little to no distraction. The game is made for students to play so they can have fun, 
               while learning for their upcoming exams. Students get easily distracted when they are behind a screen and tend to leave important things to the side, Worm Hole
               is supposed to break that habit by creating a solution from the thing that is distracting them. Students can now game and learn for their subjects at the same time.
            </p>
            <p>
               Students will show a lot more progress by doing something they enjoy, while also learning, and that is my main goal for Worm Hole to achieve 
            </p>

                <p>
                    Before I jump to the gameplay, I would like to introduce you to the target audience. Worm Hole is a game made for students but the primary focus are middle schoolers
                    ages 12-14. Middle schoolers already have a tough time transitioning from primary school to middle school so to minimalize the distraction is great for their education and future.
                    
                <p>
                    In order to make the game as fun as possible and educational I have interviewed a dozen of middle school student all aging from 12-14 on different type of topics. 
                    For me to help them I had to first get to know them better. I started off the interview with a bunch of basic questions to get to know them and their intrests a little more. 
                    I then started asking more questions about their school work and how they are handling this new enviroment. A couple questions later, and I finally managed to find out with what player type I'm dealing with.
                    A majority of the students fell under the all-round enthusiast,however there were a bunch of them who were also classified as The backseat viewer, these students had to drop gaming and focused more on school due to the change in difficulty.
                    Now that I know the target audience better, I first started off by showing my concept of the game so far. 

                </p>
                <p>
                    The first concept of the game was well received by the the target audience, they helped alot in shapping what the game is now, but also loved the existing ideas of the game.

                    Worm Hole is a 2d, turn based educational platform game made for the pc and laptop. Worm Hole is set in a corrupt lethal enviroment, 
                    CLE for short, where worm-like monsters want nothing but destroy all the books and knowledge of the world. The first edition is based on Geography.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The players get to play as popular cartoon network character Finn the Human, who is on an adventure to defeat all the worms and restore humanities knowledge.
                    In order to defeat the worms, Finn the Human has to visit different, countries and continents in order to gather information from the refugees who hold the knowledge of the places visited.
                    During this eye-opening trips in different countries Finn has to face the worms and defeat them in a battle of brains, and strength. 
                    Finn has to show that he is worthy of recapturing the stolen land mass from the worms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If Finn is ever in a pickle he always has his buddy Jake with him, who drops hints along the way and during combat, to help his buddy Finn. 
                    Once a country has been freed from the evil worm, Finn will be left to challenge one more Boss in order to free the whole continent from the corrupt lethal enviroment. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once defeating bosses and enemies alike Finn will be awarded with power-ups and currency to upgrade and store his knowledge, and defeat the rest of the worms.

                    The main core drive for the students is a sense of accomplishment after every chapter completed. The student will be rewarded with ingame items but most importantly they will also
                    be rewarded with knowledge, and will have an easier time heading into their exam or whatever challenge is awaiting them. Seeing their grades go up will not only help the students, 
                    but it will give them even more motivation to keep studying and doing their best, that will lead to their development. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The main mechanic in the game is turn based gameplay, this is how all combat in the game will playout. The reason for this is to not give the game a high skill gap when it comes to 
                    controlls, but focus on the main aspect of the game which is learning. The way combat will work is that the worms will present the player with a trivia question about the location they're holding, the player
                    must then show that he has gathered the information about the location from the locals and refugees in order to defeat the worm, the player has to pick from a set of 
                    different multiple choice questions, based on their answer they will either deal damage to the worm, or have damage dealt to them. If a player loses a battle, they get another chance
                    at asking the refugees and locals for clues and information, and whenever the student is ready they can try again. 
                
                </p>
                <p>
                   The rules of the game are simple, learn for the subject and the theory, and in order to prepare for the big test, take on the worms in Worm Hole. 
                   In order to prevent cheating in the game, because the students would be able to search up the questions, Worm Hole will be only playable under parent or teacher supervision, until later versions
                   where a software will be added that detects if a student opens a different tab on their browser, which will lead to a ban. 
                </p>
