                The Altair 8800 is one of the first personal microcomputer kits made by Henry Edwards Roberts and his
                team. The Altair 8800 kit was available in 1975 for less than $400 (M Johnson, 2014). People from
                various house hold were able to purchase one, however that was not the case. The Altair 8800 managed to
                sell quite a lot after more than 4000 orders have been placed, this was not expected especially since
                the Altair 8800 didn’t have many functions to it, nonetheless it was a great success among the other
                microcumputer kits.

                The Altair didn’t get its success just like that, what made the Altair 8800 so amazing is the fact that
                it used the Intel 8080 processor. The Intel 8080 ("eighty-eighty") is the second 8-bit microprocessor
                designed and manufactured by Intel. (Intel 8080, z.d.). The Altair 8800 was one of the first
                microcomputers that used this processor.

                <p>
                    The creator behind the Altair 8800



                    The man behind it all is no one other than Henry Edward Roberts, also known as "the father of the
                    personal computer.". Edward Roberts was a master of all crafts, he wasn’t only known as an engineer
                    he was more than that, Edward Roberts was also an entrepreneur, medical doctor and most important he
                    founded Micro Instrumentations and Telemetry Systems. Before his fame for building the first
                    microcomputer, Roberts was known for creating one of the first working electric calculators, however
                    that succes didn’t last for long. Competition grew rapidly and Roberts was forced into debt due to
                    this competition. Roberts began developing something else. A couple years later Roberts released the
                    Altair 8800 that used the new Intel 8080 processor.

                    The creation of the Altair 8800 caught the attention of young Paul Allen and Bill Gates who proposed
                    to Roberts to write software for the Altair 8800, which later lead to the creation of The Altair
                    BASIC which was Microsoft’s first creation.

                    Roberts didn’t remain in the field of technology for very long after creating the Altair 8800,
                    because in 1977, 2 years after the creation of the Altair 8800, Roberts deciced to sell MITS and
                    retire to the state of Georgia where he spent most of his time farming, studying medicine and later
                    becoming the town’s doctor.

                    The Altair 8800 wasn’t necessarily the greatest invention, since it didn’t do much, didn’t even
                    include a keyboard or mouse and didn’t come with a monitor. However these flaws that came with the
                    Altair 8800 is what drove other engineers to create better and smarter microcomputers. This has
                    created a revolutionary era where microcomputers were more accessible to not just any computer geek
                    but also your average house hold. Different companies started making their own microcomputers, the
                    market for computers and personal systems was bigger than ever. The Altair helped create this new
                    market. Edward said the following in an interview. "One of the things that became evident right away
                    was that people lusted after those machines. I don't know any better way to describe it: They lusted
                    after it," Ed Roberts told W. David Gardner in Reflections: An Oral History of the Computer
                    Industry, a supplement to Computer Systems News.
